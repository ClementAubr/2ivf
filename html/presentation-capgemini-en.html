            <p class="main-paragraphs">
                Since Capgemini offers services, it does not need to source materials
                first. However, partnerships are at the heart of its activity since it is responsible for configuring
                for customers software created by software publishers. In this way, Capgemini counts
                no less than twenty major partnerships including Adobe, , IBM, Google Cloud or Amazon
            </p>

            <h2 id="production-title">Production</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraphs">
                The most requested service at Capgemini is outsourcing, consisting of administering and ensuring
                the sustainability of all or part of a company's digital information system. This translates
                in particular by Third-Party Application Maintenance, i.e. making sure to keep the software packages in
                an optimal state of operation, even if it means taking responsibility for any problems.
                services are often applied via 3 to 5 year contracts with the company in question.
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraphs">
                Capgemini also offers software integration by implementing and configuring software packages
                so that they best correspond to what the company expects. This task is generally remunerated at
                the mission ; mission that can last several months or even a year depending on the complexity of the
                settings.
                Finally, the firm offers training in the use of digital tools as well as advice in
                the domain.
            </p>

            <h2 id="commercial-title">Commercial</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraphs">
                Capgemini segments its customer base into 2 main types of customers: companies that are interested
                by software integration or maintenance services, and those seeking advice
                to improve their productivity thanks to digital technology. The targeting is thus differentiated: one
                will receive
                outsourcing while the other will be guided by Capgemini's consulting firm.
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraphs">Capgemini is targeting a large clientele, with a range of prices that varies
                according to
                complexity of work
                demand. All companies requiring its services are concerned, whether they are small or
                large.
            </p>

            <h2 id="hrm-title">Human Resources Management</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraphs">Capgemini is a company in tune with the times, which tries in particular to
                evolve
                towards an equality of
                sexes. Thus, it promotes job and salary parity with the objective that 30% of jobs
                positions will be held by women by 2025. In addition, Capgemini is part of the Valuable 500, a
                global network of leaders involved in the inclusion of people with disabilities, with
                appropriate infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraphs">Regarding salaries, employees are well paid with salaries ranging from
                €19,500 for a new recruit, to €57,000 net per year for an experienced project manager. The
                working conditions offered are pleasant: dynamic and professional atmosphere, working hours
                flexible and able to telecommute. Employees have 25 to 33 days off per year
                according to their seniority.</p>

            <h2 id="finance-title">Finance</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraphs">Shareholders constitute an important part of the financing of the company.
                Thus, Capgemini's total capital is made up of 0.2% self-financing, 6.2% shareholders
                individuals and 85% institutional investors. Among these major players, 67.5% are based in
                the international. Finally, 8.6% of the capital is held by the group's employees.</p>

            <img src="../res/images/finance-capgemini.jpg" alt="graphique des sources de finances de capgemini">

            <p class="main-paragraphs">Nevertheless, at the end of 2021, Capgemini had approximately €3.224 billion
                debt, i.e. 37.4% of the company's equity - the latter amounting to €8.48 billion.
                This remains decent for a company the size of Capgemini. Today, the company
                continues to diversify and expand. The latest major friendly takeover is that of Altran in
                2018, specialized in engineering consulting, and renamed Capgemini Engineering.</p>

            <h2 id="compta-title">Accounting</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraphs">As required by law, the company's balance sheets are transparent and
                available directly on their official website. Capgemini regularly prepares and publishes a
                provisional calendar reflecting the next major events of the company. Thus, on the third
                quarter of 2022, Capgemini pocketed nearly 5,553 million euros and has a growth rate of
                15.7%.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraphs">In 2021, it generated a turnover of 16.8 billion euros. From
                different markets in which Capgemini is present, France represents nearly 22% of its turnover
                business, and North America contributes 32%, testifying to its global reach.
            </p>

            <img src="../res/images/compta-capgemini.jpg" alt="graphique des pourcentages de marchés de capgemini">

            <h2 id="dev-title">Research</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraphs">Capgemini advocates digital innovation and it is therefore essential
                to carry out Research work. It undertakes many works aimed at improving and making more
                complete its services like its AI. Likewise, new technologies are appearing all the time and
                it is important for Capgemini to adapt to it.</p>
            <p class="main-paragraphs">For example, a software package might start offering a new
                functionality, which Capgemini will have to learn to use, implement and configure in the way
                more optimal. It is a work of constant learning and optimization.
                The company highlights 6 main sectors in which it is very active and which it hopes
                revolutionize. These are the mobility and IT of the future, health, industry,
                data science and machine learning.
